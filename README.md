# Exercises (Try these and Drills) from Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

## Why?

Having mostly done programming sporadically and for game development I feel my foundational understanding of 
core concepts and terminology wasn't strong enough. I'll be working with Unreal Engine which uses C++, 
and I'd like to make rigid contributions to my games codebase.

In this repository you will find my solutions to mostly every excersize I found worth doing in the book.
I upload them so that others may use this repo as a reference to compare their solutions.

## About my exercises

I'm neither a seasoned programmer nor a newbie, though my knowledge is mostly concentrated on scripting
in the game development space. So, while I try to restrict myself to the contents of this book I sometimes
investigate further in an attempt to make my solutions more elegant. Though the quality of my solutions
will vary depending on how familiar I already feel with a particular chapter.

However, if an excercise specifies to use a specific method of doing something, I will adhere to it.
An example of me going further is using ternary if statements in the early chapters while they are
certainly not expected by the author. I've tried to comment my solutions where I do somehing not 
expected by the book.

- I don't use "std_lib_facilities.h" which means if functions that derive from it are required
  I will define them myself.
  
### Name Scheme

While the folders are seperated into chapters such as ch3, ch4 etc.

The .cpp files will the following naming scheme:

C03E02 - Chapter 3, Excersize 2.

Where E can be replaced by

T - Try this

D - Drill

## Post Mortem

When finished I will discuss the book and it's content here.
