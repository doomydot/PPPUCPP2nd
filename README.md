# Exercises (Try these and Drills) from Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

## About my exercises

I'm neither a seasoned programmer nor a newbie, though my knowledge is mostly concentrated on scripting
in the game development space. So, while I try to restrict myself to the contents of this book I sometimes
investigate further in an attempt to make my solutions more elegant. Though the quality will vary depending
on how familiar I already feel with a particular chapter.

However, if an excercise specifies to use a specific method of doing something, I will adhere to it.
An example of me going further is using ternary if statements in the early chapters while they are
certainly not expected by the author. I've tried to comment my solutions where I do somehing not 
expected by the book.
