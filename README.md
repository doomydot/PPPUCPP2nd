# Exercises (Try these and Drills) from Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

## Why?

Having mostly done programming sporadically and for game development I feel my foundational understanding of 
it all wasn't strong enough. And since I'll most likely be working with Unreal Engine in the future, which 
uses C++. I feel it's a good idea to build that foundation, so that I can trust and contribute to my future
games codebase.

In this repository you will find my solutions to mostly every excersize I found worth doing in the book.
I upload them so that others may use this repo as a reference to compare their solutions.

## About my exercises

I'm neither a seasoned programmer nor a newbie, though my knowledge is mostly concentrated on scripting
in the game development space. So, while I try to restrict myself to the contents of this book I sometimes
investigate further in an attempt to make my solutions more elegant. Though the quality of my solutions
will vary depending on how familiar I already feel with a particular chapter.

However, if an excercise specifies to use a specific method of doing something, I will adhere to it.
An example of me going further is using ternary if statements in the early chapters while they are
certainly not expected by the author. I've tried to comment my solutions where I do somehing not 
expected by the book.

- I don't use "std_lib_facilities.h" which means if functions that derive from it are required
  I will define them myself.

## Post Mortem

When finished I will discuss the book and it's content here.
