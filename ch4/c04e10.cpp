// c04e10.cpp
// Write a program that plays the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 
// Use a switch-statement to solve this exercise. Also, the machine should
// give random answers (i.e., select the next rock, paper or scissors
// randomly). Real randomness is too hard to provide just now, so just build
// a vector with a sequence of values to be used as "the next value". If you
// build the vector into the program, it will always play the same game, so
// maybe you should let the user enter some values. Try variations to make it
// less easy for the user to guess which move the machine will make next.
